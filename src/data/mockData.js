    notes: `# Introduction to Data Structures

## Overview
Data structures are fundamental building blocks in computer science that allow us to organize and store data efficiently.

## Key Concepts

### What are Data Structures?
- Ways of organizing and storing data in a computer
- Enable efficient access and modification of data
- Different structures are optimal for different operations

### Types of Data Structures

#### Linear Data Structures
- **Arrays**: Fixed-size sequential collection
- **Linked Lists**: Dynamic size with node-based structure
- **Stacks**: LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle
- **Queues**: FIFO (First In, First Out) principle

#### Non-Linear Data Structures
- **Trees**: Hierarchical structure with root and children
- **Graphs**: Collection of vertices connected by edges
- **Hash Tables**: Key-value pairs with hash functions

### Time and Space Complexity
Understanding Big O notation is crucial for analyzing data structures:
- **O(1)**: Constant time
- **O(log n)**: Logarithmic time
- **O(n)**: Linear time
- **O(n²)**: Quadratic time

## Next Steps
In the following lectures, we'll dive deep into each data structure, implementing them and analyzing their performance characteristics.`

    notes: `# Arrays and Dynamic Arrays

## Static Arrays

### Characteristics
- Fixed size determined at creation
- Elements stored in contiguous memory locations
- Constant time access using index: O(1)
- Cache-friendly due to memory locality

### Operations and Complexity
- **Access**: O(1)
- **Search**: O(n)
- **Insertion**: O(n) (due to shifting)
- **Deletion**: O(n) (due to shifting)

## Dynamic Arrays

### Implementation Details
Dynamic arrays (like ArrayList in Java, vector in C++, list in Python) automatically resize when needed.

### Resizing Strategy
- Typically double the size when capacity is reached
- Amortized O(1) insertion time
- Trade-off between memory usage and performance

### Code Example (Java)
\`\`\`java
public class DynamicArray<T> {
    private T[] array;
    private int size;
    private int capacity;
    
    public DynamicArray() {
        capacity = 10;
        array = (T[]) new Object[capacity];
        size = 0;
    }
    
    public void add(T element) {
        if (size == capacity) {
            resize();
        }
        array[size++] = element;
    }
    
    private void resize() {
        capacity *= 2;
        T[] newArray = (T[]) new Object[capacity];
        System.arraycopy(array, 0, newArray, 0, size);
        array = newArray;
    }
}
\`\`\`

## Applications
- Database indexing
- Image processing (2D arrays)
- Mathematical computations
- Implementing other data structures`

    notes: `# Linked Lists

## Introduction
Linked lists are dynamic data structures where elements (nodes) are stored in sequence, with each node containing data and a reference to the next node.

## Types of Linked Lists

### Singly Linked List
- Each node points to the next node
- Last node points to null
- Can only traverse in one direction

### Doubly Linked List
- Each node has pointers to both next and previous nodes
- Allows bidirectional traversal
- Requires more memory per node

### Circular Linked List
- Last node points back to the first node
- Forms a circle
- Useful for round-robin scheduling

## Implementation (Singly Linked List)

\`\`\`java
class ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode next;
    
    ListNode(int val) {
        this.val = val;
        this.next = null;
    }
}

class LinkedList {
    private ListNode head;
    
    public void insert(int val) {
        ListNode newNode = new ListNode(val);
        newNode.next = head;
        head = newNode;
    }
    
    public void delete(int val) {
        if (head == null) return;
        
        if (head.val == val) {
            head = head.next;
            return;
        }
        
        ListNode current = head;
        while (current.next != null && current.next.val != val) {
            current = current.next;
        }
        
        if (current.next != null) {
            current.next = current.next.next;
        }
    }
}
\`\`\`

## Advantages vs Disadvantages

### Advantages
- Dynamic size
- Efficient insertion/deletion at beginning: O(1)
- Memory allocated as needed

### Disadvantages
- No random access (must traverse from head)
- Extra memory for storing pointers
- Not cache-friendly due to non-contiguous memory

## Applications
- Implementation of stacks and queues
- Music playlist (next/previous song)
- Browser history (back/forward)
- Undo functionality in applications`
